# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project Repository and Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the project repository, initialize Python environment, and configure version control. Ensure compatibility with LiteLLM and required dependencies.
# Details:
- Create a new Git repository for ccproxy.
- Initialize a Python 3.10+ virtual environment (recommended for latest LiteLLM compatibility).
- Add .gitignore for Python, VSCode, and environment files.
- Install LiteLLM (latest stable, e.g., >=2.5.0), typing-extensions, and any other required dependencies.
- Set up pre-commit hooks for linting (e.g., ruff, black) and type checking (mypy).
- Document setup steps in README.md.

# Test Strategy:
Verify environment setup by running 'python -m litellm --version' and ensuring all dependencies install without errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create and Initialize Git Repository [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Git repository for the ccproxy project, including initializing version control and adding a .gitignore file for Python, VSCode, and environment files.
### Details:
Run 'git init' in the project directory. Add a .gitignore file that excludes Python virtual environments, VSCode settings, and other environment-specific files to prevent them from being tracked.

## 2. Set Up Python 3.10+ Virtual Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create and activate a Python 3.10 or newer virtual environment dedicated to the project to ensure dependency isolation and compatibility with LiteLLM.
### Details:
Use 'python3.10 -m venv venv' (or 'virtualenv -p python3.10 venv') to create the environment. Activate it using the appropriate command for your OS. Ensure the virtual environment folder is excluded from version control.

## 3. Install LiteLLM and Required Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Install the latest stable version of LiteLLM (>=2.5.0), typing-extensions, and any other required dependencies into the virtual environment.
### Details:
Use 'pip install litellm>=2.5.0 typing-extensions' and add any additional dependencies as needed. Generate a requirements.txt file using 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' to track installed packages.

## 4. Configure Pre-commit Hooks for Linting and Type Checking [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality using tools like ruff, black, and mypy for linting and type checking.
### Details:
Install pre-commit, ruff, black, and mypy in the virtual environment. Create a .pre-commit-config.yaml file specifying the hooks. Run 'pre-commit install' to activate hooks for the repository.

## 5. Document Setup Steps in README.md [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Write clear instructions in README.md detailing repository initialization, environment setup, dependency installation, and pre-commit configuration.
### Details:
Include step-by-step commands for each setup phase, explanations for each tool, and troubleshooting tips. Ensure documentation is sufficient for a new contributor to replicate the environment.
