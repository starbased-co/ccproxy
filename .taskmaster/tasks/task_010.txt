# Task ID: 10
# Title: Prepare for Deployment and Release
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Package the project for deployment, including Docker support and release automation.
# Details:
- Write a Dockerfile for containerized deployment (use python:3.10-slim as base).
- Add docker-compose.yaml for local development/testing.
- Ensure all config can be provided via environment variables for 12-factor compliance.
- Tag and release initial version (v1.0.0) on GitHub.
- Document deployment steps and recommended production settings.

# Test Strategy:
Build and run Docker image locally. Deploy to test environment and verify end-to-end functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Dockerfile for Containerized Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write a Dockerfile using python:3.10-slim as the base image, following best practices for Python applications.
### Details:
Ensure the Dockerfile uses python:3.10-slim, separates dependencies from source code, minimizes layers, and includes a HEALTHCHECK instruction. Avoid storing secrets in the image and use a .dockerignore file.

## 2. Add docker-compose.yaml for Local Development and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a docker-compose.yaml file to orchestrate the application and any required services for local development and testing.
### Details:
Define services, environment variables, volumes, and network settings needed for local development. Ensure compatibility with the Dockerfile and support for hot-reloading if applicable.

## 3. Implement 12-Factor Config via Environment Variables [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Refactor application configuration to be fully provided via environment variables for 12-factor compliance.
### Details:
Audit all configuration points and ensure they can be set using environment variables. Update documentation and code as needed to remove hardcoded values.

## 4. Automate Tagging and Release on GitHub [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Set up automation to tag and release the initial version (v1.0.0) of the project on GitHub.
### Details:
Configure release workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions) to build, tag, and publish the Docker image and source code. Ensure release notes and versioning follow semantic conventions.

## 5. Document Deployment Steps and Production Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Write comprehensive documentation covering deployment steps, environment configuration, and recommended production settings.
### Details:
Include step-by-step instructions for building, running, and configuring the application in both local and production environments. Highlight security, scaling, and monitoring recommendations.
