# Task ID: 10
# Title: Productionize: Performance, Security, and Monitoring Hardening
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Finalize production readiness with benchmarking, rate limiting, abuse prevention, and deployment best practices.
# Details:
Benchmark concurrent request handling (use locust or wrk). Implement rate limiting with slowapi or similar. Harden HTTP endpoints (CORS, timeouts, error handling). Document deployment (Dockerfile, k8s manifests). Ensure logging and metrics are production-grade. Prepare for future extensibility (plugin hooks).

# Test Strategy:
Run load tests to verify performance targets. Penetration test for security. Review deployment with best practices checklist.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Benchmark Concurrent Request Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and execute benchmarking of the application's concurrent request handling using tools like locust or wrk to assess throughput and latency under load.
### Details:
Configure benchmarking scenarios that simulate realistic traffic patterns, including varying levels of concurrency and request types. Collect and analyze performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and ensure the system meets production performance targets.

## 2. Implement and Test Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate rate limiting middleware (such as slowapi) to control the number of requests per client and prevent abuse.
### Details:
Configure slowapi with appropriate rate limits for different endpoints and user types. Ensure correct integration with FastAPI or Starlette, and handle rate limit exceeded responses gracefully.

## 3. Harden HTTP Endpoints for Security and Robustness [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply security best practices to all HTTP endpoints, including CORS configuration, request timeouts, and comprehensive error handling.
### Details:
Set up CORS policies to restrict allowed origins, configure server and application-level timeouts, and implement structured error responses. Review endpoints for common vulnerabilities and ensure secure defaults.

## 4. Document and Automate Production Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Prepare and document all deployment artifacts, including Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifests, following best practices for production environments.
### Details:
Write clear documentation for building, configuring, and deploying the application. Ensure Dockerfile and k8s manifests are optimized for security, scalability, and maintainability. Include environment variable and secret management guidance.

## 5. Ensure Production-Grade Logging, Metrics, and Extensibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Upgrade logging and metrics to production standards and prepare the codebase for future extensibility via plugin hooks.
### Details:
Implement structured logging with appropriate log levels and sensitive data redaction. Integrate metrics collection (e.g., Prometheus) for key performance and health indicators. Design and document plugin hook interfaces for future extensibility.
