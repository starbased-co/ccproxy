# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Observability, Logging, and Metrics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive logging, monitoring, and metrics for transformation events and performance, leveraging LiteLLM's observability features.
# Details:
- Use LiteLLM's built-in monitoring and logging hooks (log_transformations, metrics_enabled).
- Log all routing decisions, transformation steps, and errors with context.
- Track metrics such as transformation latency, error rates, and slow transformation events (configurable threshold).
- Integrate with Prometheus or OpenTelemetry if supported by LiteLLM for external monitoring.
- Document observability setup and log formats.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate various request scenarios and verify logs/metrics are emitted as expected. Test slow transformation threshold triggers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enable and Configure LiteLLM Logging and Monitoring Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Activate LiteLLM's built-in logging and monitoring hooks (such as log_transformations and metrics_enabled) to capture transformation events and performance data.
### Details:
Set up LiteLLM's predefined callbacks for logging and monitoring by configuring environment variables and specifying the desired logging backends (e.g., MLflow, Langfuse, Helicone, Lunary). Ensure hooks are enabled for all relevant transformation events.

## 2. Implement Contextual Logging for Routing, Transformations, and Errors [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Log all routing decisions, transformation steps, and errors with sufficient context to enable traceability and debugging.
### Details:
Instrument the code to log detailed information for each routing decision, transformation step, and error, including relevant context such as input parameters, model names, and error messages. Use LiteLLM's logging hooks and custom callbacks as needed.

## 3. Track and Emit Key Metrics for Transformations [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Collect and emit metrics such as transformation latency, error rates, and slow transformation events (with a configurable threshold).
### Details:
Use LiteLLM's metrics hooks or custom callbacks to record metrics for each transformation event. Implement logic to detect and flag slow transformations based on a configurable latency threshold.

## 4. Integrate with External Observability Tools (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry) [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Integrate LiteLLM with external observability platforms such as Prometheus or OpenTelemetry for centralized monitoring and alerting.
### Details:
Follow LiteLLM and OpenTelemetry integration guides to export metrics and traces to supported external systems. Configure exporters and environment variables as required for the chosen observability backend.

## 5. Document Observability Setup and Log Formats [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the observability setup, including configuration steps, log formats, and metric definitions.
### Details:
Document how to enable and configure logging, monitoring, and metrics in LiteLLM, including integration with external tools. Provide examples of log entries and metric outputs, and explain how to interpret them.
