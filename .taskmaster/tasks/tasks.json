        "details": "1. File location & naming\n   • Place OVERVIEW.md in the project root so GitHub automatically renders it.\n\n2. Required sections\n   • Purpose – 2–3 sentences on why ccproxy exists and its exclusively-for-Claude Code mandate.\n   • Architectural snapshot – one high-level diagram (ASCII or Mermaid) showing request → routing hook (Task 3) → LiteLLM proxy → target model.\n   • Context analysis pipeline – narrative that walks through what metadata is extracted (token count, tool usage, code size, etc.) and where (link to ccproxy_router.py once Task 3 lands).\n   • Routing labels & model mapping – bullet list describing default, background, think, large_context, web_search, and any future-proof “passthrough” label. Include a short YAML sample so readers see how Task 2’s config maps labels → models.\n   • Example routing decisions – at least five end-to-end examples:\n        1. Small snippet → \"fast\" Claude model.\n        2. Large multi-file refactor → \"powerful\" model.\n        3. Debug session with tool invocation → background model.\n        4. Long documentation generation (>16 k tokens) → large_context model.\n        5. Query containing a URL → web_search-augmented chain.\n   • Non-Goals – explicitly state ccproxy is NOT a general LLM proxy and does not attempt to optimise chat-bot traffic, summarisation tasks, etc.\n   • Extensibility hooks – brief paragraph pointing to forthcoming transformation pipeline (Task 5) and security layer (Task 7).\n   • Getting started – link to README for setup and to docs produced in Task 9.\n   • Contribution guidelines – point to coding standards (black/ruff), doc style (MD lint rules), and how to regenerate diagrams.\n\n3. Style & tooling\n   • Use GitHub-flavoured Markdown. \n   • Run markdownlint (pre-commit config from Task 1) – no MD004/MD007 violations.\n   • Keep line width ≤ 100 chars.\n\n4. Cross-references\n   • Inline links to specific source files or docs created by earlier tasks (e.g., `/ccproxy_router.py`).\n   • Tag sections with anchors (#) so other docs can deep-link.\n\n5. Commit etiquette\n   • Single commit titled “docs: add comprehensive OVERVIEW for ccproxy (Claude Code focus)”.\n   • Include screenshots/diagram images in `/docs/img/` if diagram tool requires, or embed Mermaid in-line.\n",
        "testStrategy": "• Run markdownlint to ensure zero lint errors.\n• Render OVERVIEW.md in GitHub preview and verify all internal links resolve.\n• Peer review: at least one developer from routing (Task 3) team signs off that routing description and examples align with implemented logic.\n• Confirm the document clearly states Claude Code specificity by searching for the phrase “NOT a general-purpose proxy”.\n• Check each of the five example scenarios: they must list (a) request snippet, (b) inferred context label, (c) chosen model.\n",
