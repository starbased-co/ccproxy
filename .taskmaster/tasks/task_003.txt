# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop RequestClassifier Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement request classification logic to assign routing labels based on request context (token count, model, tools, etc.).
# Details:
Encapsulate classification logic as a class with a classify(request) method. Use the priority order from the PRD. Accept request as a dict or pydantic model. Make context threshold configurable. Write pure functions for each rule for testability. Prepare for future extensibility (e.g., ML-based classification).

# Test Strategy:
Unit test all classification branches with representative request fixtures. Achieve 100% branch coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design RequestClassifier Class Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the RequestClassifier class interface, including the classify(request) method, input types (dict or pydantic model), and encapsulation of classification logic.
### Details:
Establish the class skeleton, document method signatures, and ensure the design supports future extensibility (e.g., ML-based classification).

Implemented full rule-based classification system:

• Added abstract base class `ClassificationRule` with `priority`, `evaluate(request)` and `supports(request)` hooks for extensible rule definition.
• Defined `RoutingLabel` enum covering default, background, think, large_context, and web_search paths.
• Built `RequestClassifier` with:
  – `classify(request)` accepting dict or pydantic BaseModel
  – `add_rule(*rules)`, `clear_rules()`, `reset_rules()` for dynamic rule management
  – Optional custom rule list injected at init; falls back to default rules in defined priority order.
• Introduced `Classifier` typing `Protocol` to ensure type-safe interchangeability with future ML classifiers.
• Implemented default rules:
  1. `TokenCountRule` (configurable max_tokens) → large_context
  2. `ModelNameRule` (matches lite models, e.g., “gpt-4o-mini”) → background
  3. `ThinkingRule` (detects system/assistant thinking prefix) → think
  4. `WebSearchRule` (presence of “web_search” tool call) → web_search
  5. Fallback → default
• Wrote comprehensive pytest suite (100 % line & branch coverage) exercising:
  – All routing labels and default priority ordering
  – Dict vs pydantic inputs
  – Rule addition, clearing, and resetting behaviour
  – Edge cases: empty request, unsupported fields, conflicting rules
• CI updated to enforce coverage threshold and run classifier tests in isolation.

## 2. Implement Rule-Based Classification Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop pure functions for each classification rule (e.g., token count, model, tools) and integrate them into the classify method following the PRD priority order.
### Details:
Ensure each rule is implemented as a standalone pure function for testability and maintainability. Integrate these functions within the main classification flow.
<info added on 2025-07-30T01:29:05.552Z>
Implemented TokenCountRule, ModelNameRule, ThinkingRule, and WebSearchRule as standalone pure functions and wired them into RequestClassifier._setup_rules() following the PRD priority order. Added full-stack tests covering priority conflicts, realistic request scenarios, and edge cases; test suite now passes with 100 % coverage on the classifier module and 98 % on the rules module.

## 3. Add Configurable Context Thresholds [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Enable configuration of context thresholds (e.g., token count limits) via class parameters or external config, supporting dynamic adjustment without code changes.
### Details:
Integrate context threshold parameters into the class, ensuring they can be set at initialization or updated dynamically. Document configuration options.

## 4. Prepare for Extensibility and ML Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Refactor classification logic to allow seamless addition of new rules or ML-based classifiers in the future.
### Details:
Abstract rule evaluation and routing label assignment to support plug-in architectures or ML-based decision modules. Document extension points.
<info added on 2025-07-30T03:42:36.498Z>
Scope realignment for v0.9:

• Document existing extension points: explain the ClassificationRule ABC (required methods, expected return values) and the add_rule/clear_rules API in RequestClassifier.
• Provide rich docstring examples in both RequestClassifier and ClassificationRule that show how to implement and register a custom rule.
• Add an illustrative CustomHeaderRule in the test suite; register it with add_rule and assert correct routing label on a fixture request.
• Expand unit tests to verify that custom rules can be added, cleared, and do not interfere with built-in rules.
• Remove references to future ML or plug-in architectures to avoid premature complexity.

## 5. Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests for Classification [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Create unit tests covering all classification branches, edge cases, and input types to achieve 100% branch coverage.
### Details:
Use representative request fixtures to test all rule combinations and context threshold scenarios. Ensure tests are isolated and repeatable.
<info added on 2025-07-30T19:23:58.654Z>
Achieved 100% branch and line coverage for RequestClassifier tests; all pytest suites pass. Added demo/ directory to showcase LiteLLM proxy integration:

• demo_config.yaml – full LiteLLM configuration loading CCProxy via custom_callbacks.proxy_handler_instance
• custom_callbacks.py – injects CCProxy into PYTHONPATH for config-based loading
• demo_requests.py – standalone script exercising all seven routing scenarios
• test_requests.py – verifies live proxy routing against expected models
• README.md – instructions and usage examples

Confirmed that CCProxy can be launched solely through the YAML config and functions correctly when running `litellm --config demo/demo_config.yaml --port 8888`.
