# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Model Routing Logic as LiteLLM Hook
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Reimplement claude-code-router's model selection logic as a LiteLLM call hook, supporting all routing scenarios and labels.
# Details:
- Create a Python module (e.g., ccproxy_router.py) implementing the routing logic as per PRD.
- Use the async_pre_call_hook interface from LiteLLM's custom callback API.
- Map request context (token count, model, tools, etc.) to routing labels: default, background, think, large_context, web_search.
- Support optional fields: if a label is not configured, pass through to Anthropic.
- Ensure logic is easily extensible for future routing rules.
- Add detailed logging for routing decisions (using LiteLLM's logging facilities).

# Test Strategy:
Unit test routing logic with all edge cases (token thresholds, tool presence, model names, missing config). Validate correct label assignment and fallback behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Extract Model Routing Logic from claude-code-router [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing claude-code-router implementation and PRD to extract all model selection and routing rules, including all supported routing scenarios and label mappings.
### Details:
Document all routing scenarios, label definitions (default, background, think, large_context, web_search), and the logic for mapping request context (token count, model, tools, etc.) to these labels. Identify any optional or fallback behaviors.

## 2. Design Extensible Routing Logic API for LiteLLM Hook [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Design a Python API that encapsulates the routing logic in a modular and extensible way, suitable for integration as a LiteLLM async_pre_call_hook.
### Details:
Define clear interfaces for routing rule evaluation, label assignment, and fallback handling. Ensure the design allows for easy addition of future routing rules and labels.

## 3. Implement Routing Logic as async_pre_call_hook in ccproxy_router.py [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Develop the ccproxy_router.py module implementing the extracted routing logic as a LiteLLM async_pre_call_hook, modifying the request payload as needed.
### Details:
Use the async_pre_call_hook interface to intercept and modify requests before LLM calls. Map request context to routing labels, support optional label configuration, and ensure fallback to Anthropic when labels are missing.

## 4. Integrate Detailed Logging for Routing Decisions [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Add comprehensive logging to the routing logic using LiteLLM's logging facilities, capturing all routing decisions and relevant context.
### Details:
Log input parameters, routing decisions, label assignments, and fallback events. Ensure logs are structured and compatible with LiteLLM observability features.

## 5. Validate Extensibility and Maintainability of Routing Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Review and test the implementation to ensure the routing logic is easily extensible for future rules and labels, with clear documentation and modular structure.
### Details:
Attempt to add a new routing rule or label as a test. Update documentation to reflect extension points and usage patterns.

## 6. Validate LiteLLM async_pre_call_hook Behavior (Spike) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build minimal proof-of-concept to validate LiteLLM hook behavior before full implementation. This de-risks the entire project's core dependency.
### Details:
Create a throwaway script to test: 1) Hook receives full request including metadata, 2) Streaming/non-streaming modes work correctly, 3) Error propagation from hook to client, 4) Model modification capabilities, 5) Concurrency under load (1k+ tasks). Freeze LiteLLM version after validation.

## 7. Write Unit Tests for Routing Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive unit tests for the routing logic as it's developed, ensuring early validation and continuous quality.
### Details:
Write pytest unit tests covering: 1) All routing scenarios (default, background, think, large_context, web_search), 2) Edge cases and error conditions, 3) Fallback behavior when labels are missing, 4) Token count thresholds, 5) Model name matching. Use pytest-mock for external dependencies.
