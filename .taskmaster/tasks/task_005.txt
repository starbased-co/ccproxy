# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Advanced Transformation Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable complex request/response transformations beyond basic routing, supporting chaining and composability of transformations.
# Details:
- Design a transformation pipeline allowing multiple transformations to be chained (e.g., via a list of functions or classes).
- Implement at least one advanced transformation (e.g., request rewriting, response post-processing, tool augmentation).
- Ensure transformations are composable and order-preserving.
- Provide a mechanism for users to register custom transformations via config or plugin interface.
- Document transformation API and usage examples.

# Test Strategy:
Unit and integration test transformation chaining with various combinations. Validate correct order, composability, and error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Transformation Pipeline Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement a pipeline structure that allows multiple request/response transformations to be chained in a specific order, ensuring composability and maintainability.
### Details:
Select an appropriate pipeline pattern (e.g., middleware chain or function/class sequence) to enable ordered chaining of transformations. Ensure the design supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, and can be easily extended with new transformation types.

## 2. Implement Core Transformation Interfaces and Base Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop abstract interfaces or base classes for transformations, establishing a consistent contract for input/output and chaining.
### Details:
Define clear interfaces or abstract base classes for transformations, specifying required methods (e.g., transform(request), transform(response)). Ensure compatibility with the pipeline architecture and support for both request and response flows.

## 3. Develop Advanced Transformation Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Implement at least one advanced transformation module, such as request rewriting, response post-processing, or tool augmentation, demonstrating the pipeline's capabilities.
### Details:
Choose and implement advanced transformation(s) that go beyond basic routing, such as modifying request payloads, enriching responses, or integrating external tools. Ensure these modules are compatible with the pipeline and composable with other transformations.

## 4. Enable User Registration of Custom Transformations [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Provide a mechanism for users to register and configure custom transformations via configuration files or a plugin interface.
### Details:
Design and implement a registration system that allows users to add custom transformation classes or functions through configuration or plugin discovery. Ensure user-defined transformations are loaded, validated, and integrated into the pipeline at runtime.

## 5. Document Transformation API and Provide Usage Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the transformation pipeline, interfaces, registration mechanism, and usage examples for both built-in and custom transformations.
### Details:
Write API documentation covering pipeline architecture, transformation interfaces, registration/configuration process, and example use cases. Include code samples and best practices for extending and composing transformations.
