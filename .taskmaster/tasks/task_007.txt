# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Security and API Key Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure secure handling of API keys and sensitive configuration, leveraging LiteLLM's security best practices.
# Details:
- Use LiteLLM's UserAPIKeyAuth for API key validation.
- Store sensitive config (API keys) in environment variables or secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) as per deployment best practices.
- Enforce HTTPS for all external API calls.
- Document security model and key management procedures.

# Test Strategy:
Test with valid/invalid API keys, attempt unauthorized access, and verify secure handling of secrets in logs/config.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate LiteLLM UserAPIKeyAuth for API Key Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement LiteLLM's UserAPIKeyAuth mechanism to validate API keys for all incoming requests, ensuring only authorized users can access the service.
### Details:
Configure the LiteLLM proxy to require API key authentication using UserAPIKeyAuth. Ensure that invalid or missing keys result in immediate rejection of requests.

## 2. Secure Storage of API Keys and Sensitive Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Store all API keys and sensitive configuration in environment variables or secure vaults, following best practices for secret management.
### Details:
Leverage environment variables or integrate with secure vault solutions such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to prevent hardcoding secrets in code or configuration files.

## 3. Enforce HTTPS for All External API Calls [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Ensure all external API communications use HTTPS to protect data in transit and prevent interception of sensitive information.
### Details:
Configure the application and any HTTP clients to reject non-HTTPS endpoints. Validate that all outgoing requests to external APIs are encrypted.

## 4. Implement API Key Rotation and Monitoring Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Establish processes for regular API key rotation and monitor API usage for anomalies, leveraging LiteLLM's built-in monitoring tools.
### Details:
Define a rotation schedule (e.g., quarterly) and automate key updates where possible. Set up monitoring to track API usage patterns and detect unauthorized access attempts.

## 5. Document Security Model and Key Management Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation detailing the security architecture, API key management lifecycle, and operational procedures for secure configuration.
### Details:
Document authentication flow, secret storage mechanisms, HTTPS enforcement, key rotation policy, and incident response steps. Include configuration examples and compliance notes.
