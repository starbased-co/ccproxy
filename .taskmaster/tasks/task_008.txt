# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Achieve >90% test coverage for all core modules, including routing, transformation, and error handling.
# Details:
- Use pytest (>=8.0) for unit and integration tests.
- Mock external API calls and LiteLLM interfaces where appropriate.
- Cover all edge cases, error paths, and configuration permutations.
- Integrate coverage.py for coverage reporting.
- Add CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests on push/PR.

# Test Strategy:
Run 'pytest --cov' and ensure >90% coverage. Validate tests fail on regressions or unhandled cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Test Structure and Organize Test Suites [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a clear directory and file structure separating unit and integration tests for all core modules, following the testing pyramid and grouping by functionality (routing, transformation, error handling).
### Details:
Create a test/ directory with subfolders for unit and integration tests. Ensure each core module has corresponding test files. Use naming conventions and grouping to enhance clarity and maintainability.

## 2. Implement Unit Tests with Mocking and Edge Case Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Write unit tests for each core module, mocking external API calls and LiteLLM interfaces as needed. Ensure all edge cases, error paths, and configuration permutations are tested.
### Details:
Use pytest and pytest-mock to isolate units under test. Parametrize tests to cover a wide range of inputs and configurations. Focus on fast, independent tests that validate individual functions and classes.

## 3. Develop Integration Tests for Core Module Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create integration tests that validate interactions between modules (e.g., routing and transformation), simulating realistic workflows and error scenarios.
### Details:
Set up integration test fixtures to mimic real application flows. Mock only external dependencies, allowing internal modules to interact. Include tests for error propagation and recovery.

## 4. Integrate coverage.py and Enforce Coverage Thresholds [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Configure coverage.py with pytest to measure code coverage, and enforce a >90% threshold for all core modules.
### Details:
Add coverage configuration to pytest.ini or pyproject.toml. Set up reporting to highlight uncovered lines and branches. Fail the test suite if coverage drops below the required threshold.

## 5. Automate Test Execution with CI Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Set up a continuous integration workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically run all tests and coverage checks on push and pull request events.
### Details:
Create a CI configuration file that installs dependencies, runs pytest with coverage, and enforces pass/fail criteria. Ensure results are visible in PRs and that failures block merges.
