# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Achieve >90% code coverage with unit, integration, and performance tests for all core modules and routing logic.
# Details:
Use pytest (>=8.0) and pytest-asyncio for async tests. Mock LiteLLM and external APIs. Cover all classification, routing, config, and fallback logic. Add integration tests simulating full request lifecycle. Use coverage.py to enforce coverage threshold. Include performance tests for routing overhead (<10ms per request).

# Test Strategy:
Run pytest with coverage. Fail CI if coverage <90%. Benchmark routing latency under load.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Unit Test Coverage for Core Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify all core modules, including classification, routing, config, and fallback logic, and design unit tests to achieve comprehensive branch and logic coverage.
### Details:
Enumerate all functions and classes in core modules. Define representative test cases for each logic branch, including edge cases. Use pytest (>=8.0) and pytest-asyncio for async code. Mock LiteLLM and external APIs as needed.

## 2. Implement Integration Tests for Full Request Lifecycle [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop integration tests that simulate the complete request lifecycle, covering interactions between modules and realistic scenarios.
### Details:
Set up test cases that send requests through the full stack, including classification, routing, config, and fallback. Mock external APIs and LiteLLM. Use pytest-asyncio for async flows.

## 3. Mock LiteLLM and External API Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop robust mocks for LiteLLM and all external APIs to ensure tests are deterministic and isolated from external failures.
### Details:
Implement fixtures and mock classes for LiteLLM and any external services. Ensure mocks simulate expected responses and error conditions.

## 4. Enforce and Monitor Code Coverage Thresholds [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Integrate coverage.py with pytest to enforce a minimum 90% code coverage threshold and fail CI if unmet.
### Details:
Configure coverage.py to measure coverage during test runs. Set up CI to fail if coverage drops below 90%. Generate coverage reports for review.

## 5. Develop Performance Tests for Routing Overhead [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create performance tests to benchmark routing logic, ensuring average overhead remains below 10ms per request under load.
### Details:
Use pytest and async benchmarking tools to simulate concurrent requests. Measure and record routing latency. Optimize code if overhead exceeds target.
