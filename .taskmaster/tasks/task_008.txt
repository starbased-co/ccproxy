# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Secure API Key and Secrets Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure all API keys and secrets are securely loaded from environment variables and never logged or exposed.
# Details:
Use python-dotenv for local development. Validate presence of required secrets at startup. Mask secrets in logs and error messages. Enforce HTTPS for all outbound requests using httpx (>=0.27) with verify=True. Document required environment variables.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test secret loading and masking. Attempt to log secrets and verify they are redacted. Integration test HTTPS enforcement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Load Secrets from Environment Variables Using python-dotenv [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the application to load all API keys and secrets from environment variables, utilizing python-dotenv for local development environments.
### Details:
Set up a .env file for local use and ensure python-dotenv loads these variables at startup. Avoid hard-coding any secrets in the codebase. Confirm .env is excluded from version control.

## 2. Validate Presence of Required Secrets at Startup [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement logic to check that all required API keys and secrets are present in the environment at application startup, failing fast if any are missing.
### Details:
Define a list of required environment variables. On startup, iterate through this list and raise a clear error if any are missing.

## 3. Mask Secrets in Logs and Error Messages [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Ensure that secrets are never logged or exposed in error messages by implementing masking or redaction logic throughout the codebase.
### Details:
Intercept log and error outputs to detect and redact any values matching known secrets or secret patterns before outputting.

## 4. Enforce HTTPS with Certificate Verification for Outbound Requests [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Configure all outbound HTTP requests using httpx (>=0.27) to require HTTPS with certificate verification enabled.
### Details:
Set up httpx clients with verify=True for all requests. Audit code to ensure no insecure (HTTP) endpoints are used.

## 5. Document Required Environment Variables and Security Practices [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create and maintain documentation listing all required environment variables, their purpose, and best practices for secure secrets management.
### Details:
Write documentation specifying each required secret, example .env usage, and guidelines for secure handling in different environments.
