			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop RequestClassifier Module",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by adding any missing implementation, refactoring, or documentation subtasks needed to fully deliver a robust, extensible RequestClassifier. Include steps for performance profiling, additional rule plug-in examples, and developer documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Requires design abstraction, pure-function rule set, configurability, 100 % branch coverage, and future ML extensibility—high algorithmic and testing effort."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement ModelRouter Component",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task further to cover cache strategy for model lookups, concurrency/thread-safety validation, and detailed documentation of YAML schema and hot-reload behaviour.",
			"reasoning": "Dynamic config loading, fallback logic, hot-reload, and validation introduce moderate architectural and concurrency concerns."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build CCProxyHandler as LiteLLM CustomLogger",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Add subtasks for end-to-end manual QA with real providers, concurrency stress tests on async_pre_call_hook, and security audit of logged metadata.",
			"reasoning": "Integrates multiple components asynchronously, must avoid sensitive logging, support streaming, and remain compatible with external library versions."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate MetricsCollector for Routing and Performance",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for metrics aggregation under high load, retention/rotation strategy, and dashboard creation (Grafana or equivalent).",
			"reasoning": "Moderate scope involving instrumentation, endpoint exposure, and integration, but leverages well-known libraries."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Secure API Key and Secrets Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Include subtasks for secret rotation procedures, automated lint rule to detect committed secrets, and developer onboarding guide for secure practices.",
			"reasoning": "Security critical but conceptually straightforward; mainly configuration, validation, and logging hygiene."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Comprehensive Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Further decompose into subtasks for CI optimisation (parallelisation, test matrix), flaky test detection, and detailed performance benchmarking harness.",
			"reasoning": "Covers unit, integration, performance tests across entire system with >90 % coverage and latency targets—significant breadth and tooling complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Write Documentation and Usage Examples",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Add subtasks for automated doc build in CI, versioned documentation strategy, and inclusion of interactive examples (e.g., Jupyter notebooks or Repl.it).",
			"reasoning": "Requires comprehensive, user-friendly docs across multiple sections; moderate complexity but largely editorial."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Productionize: Performance, Security, and Monitoring Hardening",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for blue-green deployment strategy, auto-scaling policy definition, chaos testing, and SOC2/ISO compliance checklist alignment.",
			"reasoning": "Multiple advanced production facets—performance, rate limiting, security, deployment artifacts—requiring cross-disciplinary expertise and validation."
