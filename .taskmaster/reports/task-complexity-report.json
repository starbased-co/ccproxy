		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Environment",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into: (1) repository and directory structure, (2) Python environment and dependency management, (3) pre-commit hooks, (4) CI/CD pipeline configuration, (5) environment variable management, and (6) documentation of setup steps and developer onboarding.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows well-established patterns in Python projects. Complexity arises from integrating multiple tools (Poetry/pip-tools, pre-commit, CI/CD, .env management) and ensuring reproducibility, but each step is standard in modern Python development. Slight expansion is recommended to ensure onboarding and documentation are not overlooked."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Manager",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to cover: (1) schema design, (2) YAML loader, (3) environment variable merging, (4) schema validation, (5) hot-reload logic, (6) singleton/injection pattern, and (7) error handling and recovery for malformed configs.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves advanced configuration management, including schema validation, hot-reload, and environment overrides. These requirements increase cyclomatic and cognitive complexity, especially with robust error handling and runtime reloads. Additional subtasks for error recovery and validation are justified."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop RequestClassifier Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to include: (1) class/interface design, (2) rule-based logic implementation, (3) configuration of thresholds, (4) extensibility for ML integration, (5) comprehensive unit testing, and (6) documentation and example usage.",
			"reasoning": "While the rule-based classifier is conceptually straightforward, ensuring extensibility, configurability, and testability adds moderate complexity. Industry best practices suggest explicit documentation and usage examples to support future ML-based extensions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement ModelRouter Component",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to: (1) config loading/parsing, (2) label-to-model mapping, (3) fallback logic, (4) startup validation, (5) hot-reload support, and (6) error reporting and diagnostics.",
			"reasoning": "Dynamic mapping, fallback strategies, and hot-reload introduce moderate complexity. Robust error handling and diagnostics are critical for production reliability, warranting an additional subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build CCProxyHandler as LiteLLM CustomLogger",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to: (1) class structure, (2) request classification/model routing integration, (3) structured logging, (4) streaming/non-streaming support, (5) security and compatibility validation, and (6) error handling and fallback logging.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires integrating multiple components, handling async flows, and ensuring security (no sensitive data leakage). Supporting both streaming and non-streaming requests, plus robust error handling, increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate MetricsCollector for Routing and Performance",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to: (1) metrics schema/labeling, (2) collector implementation, (3) /metrics endpoint, (4) integration with handler, (5) monitoring integration tests, and (6) alerting and dashboard documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Metrics integration is moderately complex, especially with per-label tracking and performance under load. Industry standards recommend including alerting and dashboard documentation for operational readiness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Secure API Key and Secrets Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to: (1) secret loading, (2) presence validation, (3) masking/redaction, (4) HTTPS enforcement, (5) documentation, and (6) automated security testing.",
			"reasoning": "Security tasks require careful handling of secrets, validation, and enforcement of secure practices. Automated security testing is a best practice and should be explicitly included."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Comprehensive Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to: (1) unit test design, (2) integration tests, (3) mocking external dependencies, (4) coverage enforcement, (5) performance tests, (6) CI integration, and (7) test data management and fixtures.",
			"reasoning": "Achieving >90% coverage across async, integration, and performance scenarios is highly complex. Managing test data and fixtures, and integrating with CI, are essential for maintainability and reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Write Documentation and Usage Examples",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to: (1) site infrastructure, (2) installation/configuration guides, (3) API reference, (4) migration/usage examples, (5) troubleshooting, and (6) continuous documentation validation (e.g., doc tests).",
			"reasoning": "Documentation is moderately complex, especially with migration guides and real-world examples. Continuous validation (doc tests) ensures accuracy as the codebase evolves."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Productionize: Performance, Security, and Monitoring Hardening",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to: (1) benchmarking, (2) rate limiting, (3) endpoint hardening, (4) deployment automation, (5) production-grade logging/metrics, (6) plugin/extensibility hooks, and (7) operational runbooks and incident response documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Production hardening involves cross-cutting concerns (performance, security, deployment, extensibility). Including operational runbooks and incident response aligns with industry standards for production readiness."
