- Multiple system reminders (not all cached)
- Tool results start appearing
- Complex multi-file reads
- Average 4 breakpoints per flow
- Cached sizes increase (14-16KB average)

Pattern highlights:
- Flow 26: User interruption pattern
- Flow 27-28: Box-drawing character discussion
- Flow 29-31: Model switching and autocmd requests
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Cache Pattern Evolution

### Flows 1-5: Initial Learning
- System messages always cached
- User queries never cached
- Assistant responses start getting cached

### Flows 6-15: Pattern Stabilization
- Consistent 4 breakpoint pattern
- High efficiency across all flows
- System cache reuse evident

### Flows 16-25: Advanced Patterns
- Multi-turn conversations
- Exit responses cached
- Tool results begin caching
- Summary requests appear

### Flows 26-31: Mature Implementation
- Continuation handling
- Complex interactions
- Consistent cache strategy

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

1. **System Messages**: 100% cached in all flows (except empty Flow 24)
2. **User Queries**: Never cached - always dynamic
3. **System Reminders**: Selectively cached (6.5% overall)
4. **Assistant Responses**: Exit responses and summaries cached
5. **Tool Results**: Emerging pattern in later flows

### Performance Impact
- Average speedup: 4.6x
- Cache hit rate: 82%
- Cost reduction: 90% after 2 requests
- Break-even: 2 uses
