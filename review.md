# Code Review Summary: CCProxy Implementation

After a comprehensive code review using o3, here are the findings organized by severity:

## ðŸ”´ HIGH Priority Issues (Immediate Attention Required)

### First-Call Sync I/O in Cached Async Method - `context_manager.py:56-102`

- **Issue**: While `get_context()` is async and uses LRU caching, the initial file read and `Path.stat()` calls are synchronous
- **Impact**: First request for each session file blocks the event loop; subsequent requests are cached
- **Current mitigation**: LRU cache prevents repeated blocking for the same file
- **Remaining issue**: `latest_session.stat().st_mtime` on line 98 is always synchronous
- **Fix for completeness**:

```python
from asyncio import to_thread
mtime = await to_thread(lambda: latest_session.stat().st_mtime)
messages, session_id = await to_thread(
    self._cached_read_session, str(latest_session), mtime)
```

**Note**: The provider metadata store already implements proper async I/O with `ThreadPoolExecutor`

### Tokenizer Cache Duplication - `rules.py:48`

- **Issue**: Each `TokenCountRule` instance has its own tokenizer cache
- **Impact**: Heavy tiktoken objects duplicated in memory, increasing usage
- **Fix**: Make cache class-level:

```python
class TokenCountRule(ClassificationRule):
    _tokenizer_cache: ClassVar[dict[str, Any]] = {}
```

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM Priority Issues

## Top 2 Priority Fixes

1. **Convert sync I/O to async** in `ContextManager.get_context()`
2. **Make tokenizer cache class-level** in `TokenCountRule`

## Recommended Refactoring Approach

1. Start with the high-priority async I/O fix to prevent production performance issues
2. Optimize memory usage by sharing tokenizer cache
